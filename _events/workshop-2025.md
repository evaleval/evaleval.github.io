## About the Workshop

We’re excited to announce the upcoming **Evaluating AI in Practice** workshop, happening on **December 8, 2025**, in **San Diego**.

This full-day event will explore how to evaluate AI systems responsibly and effectively by bridging three essential dimensions:

**Statistical Methods** – Techniques to quantify uncertainty, aggregate evaluation data, and estimate latent model capabilities while ensuring reliability and validity.

**Sociotechnical Perspectives** – Understanding task selection, societal impacts, and the implications of evaluation results for downstream applications.

**Evaluating Evaluation Results** – Translating evaluation outcomes into meaningful insights about model capabilities, risks, and potential downstream impacts.

The workshop will feature a **keynote by Stella Biderman**, followed by interactive sessions designed to connect technical methods with broader ethical and social considerations in AI evaluation.

**Space is limited; please register at the earliest: [https://luma.com/ngj395u2](https://luma.com/ngj395u2)**

Further details, including the full program and additional speakers, will be announced soon.
