description: The Eleuther Harness Tutorials project is designed to lower the barrier to entry for using the LM Evaluation Harness, making it easier for researchers and practitioners to onboard, evaluate, and compare the performance of language models. While many benchmark datasets exist, they are often underutilized due to implementation complexity and a lack of accessible guidance. Our goal is to change that—by providing clear, practical tutorials, we aim to democratize model evaluation, promote reproducibility, and ensure that rigorous, transparent benchmarking becomes standard practice across the AI community.
